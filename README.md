# Library Management System

Welcome to the Library Management System of Milan University! This system allows you to manage various operations such as admin login, customer authentication, issuing books, and returning books. The system ensures that only valid users and customers can access the respective features.

## Features

1. **Admin Login**
   - The admin can log in using a predefined Admin ID.
   - The system supports three valid Admin IDs: `45678`, `1234`, and `321`.
   - Admin login requires entering a password that matches the user ID.

2. **Customer Authentication**
   - Customers are authenticated based on their IDs. 
   - Valid customer IDs: `milan`, `partha`, `anu`.

3. **Book Issue**
   - Customers can request to issue one of the available books.
   - Available books include: `DSA`, `Cpp`, and `OS`.

4. **Book Return**
   - Customers can return books, and the library inventory is updated.
   - If the returned book wasn't previously in the library's inventory, it will be added to the collection.
